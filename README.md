# Federated-Learning
Detecting malware is a crucial step in ensuring the security of computer systems and networks. As a result, computer systems may experience data loss, system malfunctions, and network disruptions, among other severe consequences. Malware detection entails locating malicious software and taking the necessary precautions to prevent further damage. In this investigation, we describe a federated learning-based methodology for malware detection. Federated learning is a machine learning technique that enables multiple devices or systems to collaboratively train a machine learning model without exchanging their original
data. Instead, the only items shared between devices or systems are the model parameters. Weâ€™ve implemented a number of well-known Machine Learning algorithms. Despite the fact that some machine learning (ML) models outperformed our proposed federated learning, it is still one of the best approaches available due to the privacy and security it provides. We were able to achieve an effective detection rate of 98 percent, which is quite excellent.
